# Temperature-Prediction-Using-Various-Algorithms
In this project we have used various kinds of Machine Learning Algorithms or Model to predict the Weather Forecast.
This dataset consists the recorded temperature from the year 2006 - year 2016.
In this, we have used 4 Machine Learning Models for prediction of the temperature over a period of time.
We got various error values while predicting the temperature.

# Linear Regression       --> 0.8947929505133739
# Polynomial Regression   --> 0.8947929505133739
# Decision Tree Regressor --> 0.0060247966332408
# Random Forest Regressor --> 0.0031192165348006

From the above error rates, we can say that Random Forest Regressor has very less error rate. So, we get better prediction if we use it.
